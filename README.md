Proper classification of documents is of tremendous
importance for an organization. As digital copies of documents
are now available due to technological advances, it has become
convenient to classify them automatically using machine learning
or deep learning algorithms. Deep CNNs have been widely
applied for document image classification, whereas newly introduced transformer-based models have also presented favorable
outcomes. In this paper, one of the advanced and very highperforming deep CNN models, ConvNext V2, developed very
recently, has been adapted for document image classification
task, that leverages the imitation of the self-attention mechanism
of transformers through the use of masked autoencoders. Prior
studies have suggested that models pre-trained on ImageNet
may not perform optimally when directly applied to document
classification tasks. Nevertheless, our findings reveal substantial
enhancements in performance using ConvNext V2, indicating that
further domain-specific pre-training (for instance, on the RVLCDIP dataset) might not be essential for attaining high accuracy.
Our results demonstrate that effective, direct application of
ImageNet pre-trained models can yield significant benefits. The
model has been applied to one of the most standard document
image classification datasets Tobacco-3482. The results show a
high overall accuracy of 92.25% with fast convergence, outperforming several other state-of-the-art methods.
